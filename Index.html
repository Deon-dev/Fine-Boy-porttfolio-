        <h2>SPORTS</h2>
        <p>At its core, sports are physical activities that involve skillful exertion for pleasure or competition. This could include anything from kickball on the playground to competitive swimming in the Olympics – all having their own unique characteristics and rules making them unique from one another.</p><br>
        <p>For example, basketball differs from soccer due to each sport requiring different skill sets like dribbling versus passing respectively. As you can see, even though they both fall under the umbrella term “sports” they still have their own special nuances that make them stand out from one another.</p></div>

        <h2>TOURISM</h2>
        <p>Tourism refers to traveling for pleasure, leisure, or business purposes, and involves visiting various destinations to experience new cultures, activities, and environments. It is a product of modern social arrangements, with its origins in western Europe in the 17th century.</p><br>
        <p>The tourism industry is argued to be the largest industry in the world, providing more employment than any other industry. Note, however, the use of the word ‘argued’. You see, the tourism industry is somewhat grey in nature. Elements that some may consider ‘tourism’, others may not. Some people believe they are ‘tourists‘, when others do not. Some things are black and white, and others are not.</p></div>

        <h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p>Technology is the practical application of scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems and improve human welfare. It aims to achieve either a commercial or industrial objective.</p>
        <p>Imagine a world with no ubiquitous technology, no internet, vehicles, phones, machines, and electricity. We can agree that it is a nightmare.
        </p><br>
        <p>Every part of your daily life revolves around using technology. Do you own an online business? The internet and software tools you use are gifts of technology. It is true for our cooking tools, cars, buses, trains, and modern medicine.</p>
        <p>Technology improves the human environment and solves problems. For example, early humans used stones to create fire, hunt, and forge weapons in the Stone Age. This technological development helped the early people survive.</p></div>
